# react-movie-labs

I have created a movie app. In this app I have included multiple pages including home, favourites, upcoming, popular and top rated movies. I tried to add a now playing page but i couldn't successfully get that page working. Once i got the upcoming movies page working in the labs, creating other pages wasn't too diffiuclt. Although saying that I defininitely had my struggles at times. The first page I created outside of the labs was popular movies. This took me a while to get working as I didn't fully understand it. 

I think what confused me the most was the api folder. Once i finally understood it after getting it wrong multipe times I was able to repeat a very similar process for the other pages. Depending on the page sometimes the api code would change a little bit but overall it would remain fairly similar and I would then just have to rename the neccessary parts of the code to the new page name.
