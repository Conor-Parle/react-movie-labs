# react-movie-labs

I have created a movie app. In this app I have included multiple pages including home, favourites, upcoming, popular and top rated movies. I tried to add a now playing page but i couldn't successfully get that page working. Once i got the upcoming movies page working in the labs, creating other pages wasn't too diffiuclt. Although saying that I defininitely had my struggles at times. The first page I created outside of the labs was popular movies. This took me a while to get working as I didn't fully understand it.
